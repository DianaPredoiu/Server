                                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Style of food : </strong>Modern Spanish</li>

							<br><br>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The collective genius of the Roca brothers is well documented. The holy trinity of head chef Joan's thoughtful but original cooking, pastry chef Jordi's 
							imagination-defying desserts and sommelier Josep's beautifully considered wine pairings already adds up to significantly more than the sum of its parts, 
							before you add in a vibrant family dynamic and a deep sense of hospitality. </p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the reason this 55-seat contemporary Catalan restaurant is back on top of the world is the trio's equal brilliance in ensuring that they never stop 
							feeding their own (and their team's) knowledge and imaginations through unusual initiatives.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2013, they premiered El Somni, a theatrical multi-sensory production that explored the interaction between food, music and art. In 2014, the entire 
							team embarked on an ambitious and unprecedented restaurant tour across the southern US and part of Latin America, temporarily closing the restaurant back home 
							in the meantime. Less publicly, El Celler is at the forefront of a "gastro-botanical" research project called Terra Animada that is cataloguing rare wild 
							species with the aim of reintroducing them into our food systems.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of the above examples would matter, of course, if they didn't feed back into the evolution and progression of the dining experience at El Celler de 
							Can Roca. A meal in the tranquil glass-walled dining space is at once comforting and yet gastronomically challenging, the food simultaneously artisanal and 
							technical, with references to both the traditional and the avant-garde. Crucially, this is a restaurant that has never forgotten its humble roots, its sense 
							of familial warmth, or the need to serve remarkably delicious dishes and outstanding wines.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the fact that Massimo Bottura frequently travels the globe, has built an international reputation and has seen his recent book,
							Never Trust a Skinny Italian Chef, published in several languages, his food remains deeply Italian. In fact, his dishes are a joyful celebration of 
							Emilia-Romagna – the chef's food-producing home province of northern Italy in which his elegant restaurant resides. </p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bottura is renowned for his twists on Italian culinary mores – Five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano sees the region's famed cheese served
							in forms and textures most diners will never have experienced, for example – but his menu also includes deliciously executed classics such as tagliatelle 
							with hand-chopped ragu and risotto cooked with veal jus.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In parallel, the Sensations tasting menu experiments with local, seasonal ingredients to extraordinary effect. From snacks such as 
							exquisite rabbit macaroons through eel ravioli to suckling pig with balsamic vinegar, dining at Osteria Francescana is an exploration of the region's produce 
							and traditions delivered in a supremely contemporary fashion. It's also a reflection of Bottura's inquisitive nature; he is always looking at how to evolve his
							country's food, inspired by art, music, his family and his travels.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now 20 years old, the restaurant is located in Modena's quiet back streets and houses a series of striking modern artworks across several 
							dining spaces. The faultless service and imaginative wine programme is directed with quiet charisma by Beppe Palmieri. But it's in the kitchen, as well as in
							Bottura's inventive imagination, that the real magic is produced.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been something of a whirlwind 12 months for René Redzepi and the team from Noma. As well as reclaiming the number one spot 
							in the 2014 edition of The World's 50 Best Restaurants list, Redzepi upped sticks and moved Noma to Japan for a hugely over-subscribed five-week pop-up 
							earlier this year that received wild critical acclaim. </p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now back on Danish soil, the Noma team has been re-energised by its experience in the Land of the Rising Sun, where indigenous 
							ingredients such as raw botan ebi shrimp and wild duck were served to Tokyo diners with dramatic effect.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now they have turned their attention to Redzepi's beloved Nordic terroir once again. Dishes are in step with the seasons, such as
							milk curd and the first garlic of 2015; and the first green shoots of spring with a scallop marinade. And it sees Redzepi doing what he does best: playing 
							with techniques such as fermenting and pickling for creations beyond most people's eating perceptions.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noma’s ability to remain fresh and to assimilate culinary cultures other than its own demonstrates not just the immense skill 
							of Redzepi and his team, but also the global importance of Noma. It remains among the most influential restaurants of this century.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chef Virgilio Martinez has taken Peruvian cuisine to a whole new extreme elevation. Central, which captured the top spot on Latin 
							America's 50 Best Restaurants list in 2014, takes diners on a vertical journey across Peru's landscape, serving native ingredients sourced at various 
							altitudes. The mountains, sea, desert and jungle are all represented as Central's tasting menu travels from 25 metres below to 4,200 metres above sea 
							level. </p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The restaurant celebrates Peru's biodiversity and ancient Andean heritage, pushing culinary limits to delight guests with inventive 
							creations. Produce from the restaurant's urban garden and the in-house filtration system (promising the purest of water) are a strong presence. But diners
							must also try ingredients previously unknown to the majority of Peruvians, let alone the rest of the world. These include cushuro, the caviar-like bacteria 
							found in the mountains after a rainstorm; tunta, a white freeze-dried tuber dating back to Inca times; and airampo, a bright magenta member of the cactus-family
							grown in the Andes.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martinez's Mater Iniciativa research project plays a central role in developing the restaurant's identity and ideology. The chef, 
							who worked across the world before returning home to open Central in 2009, has led the formation of an interdisciplinary team combining gastronomy with 
							nutrition, history, anthropology, and science. He and his cohorts regularly travel across Peru to discover and study local ingredients, feeding the 
							extraordinary culinary narrative played out on the plates of the restaurant.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the recipe for an outstanding restaurant is creating the perfect balance between great food and impeccable service,
							then Eleven Madison Park co-owners Daniel Humm and Will Guidara have hit the jackpot. The pair believe in running the restaurant from both sides 
							of the wall – the kitchen and the dining room – and the combination of chef Humm's talent with Guidara's front-of-house charisma makes for an 
							unforgettable experience. </p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite dazzlingly white tablecloths and a grand, high-ceiling dining room, there is not a hint of stuffiness here. Dishes 
							are playful and often interactive – the "Name That Milk" dessert comes as an ornate wooden box containing four bars of specially commissioned Mast 
							Brothers chocolate, some pencils and a card with four animal drawings. Diners must taste each bar to determine which belongs to which animal: cow's milk,
							sheep's, goat's or buffalo's. Humm's tasting menu focuses on New York's rich agricultural bounty, but dishes are frequently adapted and tailored specifically 
							for guests, who are each painstakingly researched by Guidara's team to create the perfect bespoke experience.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The duo met a decade ago, brought together by legendary restaurateur Danny Meyer, from whom they bought Eleven Madison Park in 2011. 
							The deep friendship is clear in the atmosphere at the restaurant – it's Humm and Guidara's party and everyone is invited.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Mugaritz, there is no menu – at least, not in advance of a meal. Diners are instead treated to 24 individually tailored courses 
							to suit their dietary requirements, wants and desires. The lack of menu is just one example of how Mugaritz dispenses with traditional dining norms in its 
							quest to deliver a complete sensory and creative experience. Edible cutlery and centrepieces are other routes to delivering the stories, flavours, smells 
							and textures that make up chef-owner Andoni Luis Aduriz's idea of the perfect journey through food. </p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in the Basque gastronomic heartland of San Sebastián and schooled at El Bulli with the legendary Ferran Adrià, it's no surprise 
							Aduriz is capable of extraordinary things. He started culinary studies but soon began to explore tastes and textures after a not-so-perfect introduction to
							the academic world. In 1998, Mugaritz was born and in 2006 it entered this list, helping secure Aduriz's place among the Spanish greats.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Named after a solitary, 200-year-old oak tree that grows in the hills inland from San Sebastián, Mugaritz is as spectacular in its 
							location as in its food. The small wooden building – entirely rebuilt after a devastating fire in 2010 – is surrounded by breath-taking scenery, further 
							enhancing the sensory experience delivered by dishes such as edible stones or candy caviar.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Dinner by Heston Blumenthal opened less than five years ago, many wondered whether it would offer London the same hyper-experimental
							cuisine as the chef's famous The Fat Duck in Berkshire. But by celebrating bigger, more boisterous flavours, recreating British culinary history and teleporting
							age-old recipes into the 21st century, Dinner has carved out its very own niche. </p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firm signature dishes such as meat fruit (a ball of chicken liver parfait encased in mandarin jelly) and tipsy cake (brioche soaked 
							in Sauternes, brandy and vanilla cream served with spit-roast pineapple) have long gained cult status, but Dinner continues to reinvent the past with 
							ever-evolving creations.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eponymous chef is a guiding rather than a physical presence here, with Blumenthal's long-term right-hand-man, Ashley Palmer-Watts,
							in charge of the kitchen. Under his direction, chefs bring forgotten dishes from as far back as the 1300s back to life, using present-day ingredients and 
							modernist cooking techniques. For what seems simple on the plate has been cleverly constructed with the precision of molecular gastronomy by chefs working
							across four kitchens.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dinner is not about avant-garde wizardry or table theatrics. Instead it offers flavour-led cooking that showcases 600 years of
							British cuisine and provides diners with a world-class contemporary dining experience. </p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonderment is Yoshihiro Narisawa's stock in trade. As the restaurant has eased past the decade mark, the chef's love of the poetry 
							of the natural world has come ever more to the fore in his menus. Today his dishes share many qualities of the best haiku: restrained and highly thoughtful
							without being austere or anything less than generous. Narisawa – the restaurant, the man and his food – are all deeply in tune with the landscape and the
							moment. </p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though this is a decidedly international restaurant – more cosmopolitan in its outlook than many of its Tokyo contemporaries,
							and with a distinct French bedrock to its cooking – unique Japanese products are still the focal point. These include fugu from Aichi prefecture, skewered,
							grilled and served with sudachi citrus; or irabu sea snake from Okinawa transformed into an elegant broth abob with cubes of taro. The now-famed ritual of 
							fermenting and baking the bread at the table, meanwhile, takes place amidst an extraordinary nest of twigs and leaves.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drinks programme is just as compelling. This might well be the best place in the world to develop a nuanced appreciation
							of the winemaking of Japan, with pinot noir from Nagano, riesling lion from Iwate, aged Bordeaux-style blends from Yamagata and beyond. This alluring 
							combination results in the restaurant enjoying a stellar international reputation, reflected in its status as the leader in its continent and one of the
							very finest restaurants in the world.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something of a rock star in Brazil, Alex Atala has amassed more than 200,000 Instagram followers – as much fans of his food pics as
							of his tattoos, his dogs and his frequent trips to the Amazon in search of new ingredients. It is on these trips that the DJ-turned-chef gains inspiration
							and fuel for his main objective: to reshape Brazilian food using the country’s rich natural resources, while respecting the environment and working with
							local producers and indigenous communities. </p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atala is visibly passionate when talking about the Amazon and his most recent findings, urging diners at D.O.M. to sample each 
							ingredient so that he can share his discoveries. His favourites include jambu, a tongue-tingling herb that he also sells in a potent cachaça, and priprioca,
							a root previously used only in cosmetics and developed into a foodstuff after his team's meticulous research. Such produce forms the centrepiece of a pared
							back à la carte list as well as four- or eight-course tasting menus.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.O.M.'s dining room is formal yet relaxed, intimate yet open. One of the most expensive restaurants in São Paulo, 
							its prices reflect the cost of transporting ingredients from the most remote parts of Brazil. But just down the road is Dalva e Dito, Atala's second,
							more informal and lower-priced restaurant with a broader menu.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The street food of his home town of Kolkata and a formative stint at El Bulli are the twin inspirations behind chef Gaggan 
							Anand's boundary-pushing restaurant in downtown Bangkok. Set up in 2010 and taking top spot in this year’s Asia's 50 Best Restaurants, Gaggan reinvents
							regional Indian cuisine using modernist cooking methods. The approach is playful, adventurous and thought-provoking with classic street dishes deconstructed
							and reinterpreted without losing what made them special in the first place. It's a clever balancing act that clearly draws on skills and techniques acquired
							by the chef during an internship with Ferran Adrià's research team in Spain.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquid nitrogen, smoke and dehydrated ingredients add theatre as well as texture and flavour to the chef's creations. Lamb chops
							are given a molecular makeover with smoked whisky, spherified yoghurt and mango chutney, while the humorously named Green with Envy sees green peppercorn
							chicken kebabs combined with coriander foam.</p>
							<br>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Housed in a colonial-style building with cane furniture, ceiling fans and white-washed walls, the dining room has an elegant charm.
							There are several private dining spaces, including one looking directly into the kitchen where guests can witness the gastronomic wizardry for themselves.
							Polished service and an excellent drinks list, including cutting-edge cocktails, complete the standout experience.</p>
